LABEL - (Can you change this back to Kommune? Can you add youtube and instagram icons to this page?)

Hello! It's Zack here again. I started Kommune Records as an outlet for myself to release my music. I have no idea how far this idea will go but I am committed to giving it my best shot. Up until this point I have been mostly a guitarist and songwriter playing around San Diego and most of what I've recorded has been released by my friends at Tee Pee Records from New York. 2021 will be different for me in that I will release my first solo record on my own. I wrote and produced the album and did a fair amount of the engineering as well. Since this project has been a DIY effort I thought it would be fitting to see it through to its physical release. The first will be available digitally on streaming services January 1st 2021. There is not yet an official release date for the record. If you want to keep up with new content and releases please subscribe to the Kommune Youtube channel here - ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP1aOHajrPpdFwc2aR_klYg )
or follow me on instagram here ( https://www.instagram.com/kommune.records/ ). Many thanks and much love xoxo - Zack

If your able to add youtube/instagram icons as links then its cool with me if you shorten the above paragraph to the paragraph below...

Can we change the PRODUCTION page to CONTACTS? I want to eventually feature a page with links to projects that I've worked on other than my own music but I think easy does it for now...
